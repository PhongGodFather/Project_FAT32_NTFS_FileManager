A quick photo taken in the afternoon of the day when I was still in high school. At that time, I didn't think much of it, just saw the beautiful scenery so I took it. Sometimes, in the midst of the hustle and bustle of life, people forget the little things that make themselves happy. One of those things is peace. The place where I find a piece of peace, a space for myself is when I return here, back to my carefree days. The space stored in the picture at that moment is extremely quiet, creating a feeling of lightness and leisure, despite the hustle and bustle of life. Every time I come home, this is always a certain place I have to stop by to forget the hustle and bustle of life, to drop into my own peaceful space.
